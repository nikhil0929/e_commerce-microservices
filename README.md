# e_commerce-microservices
Rebuilding [e_market backend](https://github.com/nikhil0929/e_market) with microservice architecture

## How to run Products Microservice
#### (The only microservice I have implemented thus far)

```
$ go run main.go
```

This should spin up the products microservice on localhost:4001

BTW I have not tested this microservice yet. Im going to bed now im tired ill do it later


## TODOs
- Implement other services
  - ~~products~~
  - cart
  - orders
  - users
- Dockerize microservices
- Kubernetes???
- Sensu monitoring for each service
